# simulatr

Simulation studies play a crucial role in the development and assessment of statistical methods. However, writing portable and scalable simulation code is challenging. `Simulatr` decouples the *specification* of a simulation from the *execution* of a simulation, enabling users to develop a simulation study on their laptop and then seamlessly run the simulation at-scale on a distributed computing platform. Supported platforms include high-performance computing clusters and cloud computing services (e.g., Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, etc.).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("timothy-barry/simulatr")
```
